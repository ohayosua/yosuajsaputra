MAL is currently one of the largest online database for anime and manga. It provides its users to organize and rate anime and manga to his or her liking. In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis with the datasets taken from MAL's api to gather insights and built a recommender system utilizing collaborative filtering and k-nearest neighbors. The goal is to improve MAL's current recommender system which runs as a human recommender, soley dependent on its users.

I have built a web scraper that takes the input of location and state from the user and retrieves yelp's top 50 businesses sorted by the order of most reviewed. The data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame and automated onto my google sheet as process is scheduled every hour. 

**Google Sheets:** Results of Yelp's data from the web scraper onto Gsheets. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3YkE1EWAmT4SsDnMcxX8Ft-p4RaTEqSEfVJbRUWcf0/edit?usp=sharing) to view sheet.
